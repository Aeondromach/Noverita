        <description><p>The by-far most common language spoken across Terra, thanks to the rapid colonialism of the Cælum Dominion. Ænglisc is not far off from our real-world English language, though notably possesses more letters, and does not use our conventional lettering.
        The language was first thought to have been created even before the Prophet wandered and united the Middle-East and greater European empires in the 1st century, most historians would believe that the language first started out as something we'd see today as
        a "foreign" language, and thorugh time, slowly evolved into what we have today. In fact, ænglisc seems to be a "child" of the Glóthic language, spoken in Eastern European Countries, such as Italy and Greece, as there is substantial evidence that even the Prophet
        spoke glóthic, being that the Palítheia is written in glóthic, meaning that all that the Prophet has authored was in fact, in a language other than ænglisc.</p></description>
