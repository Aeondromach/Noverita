			<p>Humans are the most vast form in Veritas, they are diverse yet united. Humans don't really have any one weakness, as they change so much from location to location. Most humans can be found living in urban territories along water sources, especially Ocean-sides. Human cultures tend to vary by continent, though cultures really don't tend to be the exact same person to person.</p>
