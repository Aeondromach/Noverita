# Noverita v0.0
## Open Source JavaFX Project
Noverita is a character creator and editor for a based in dnd modern system. In short, Noverita is a character creator that runs on its own unique system. Because of this, you may have no use in this project for its intended function. But thats where you would be partly wrong! I believe that it is a right to be able to have easy and free access to knowledge, especially when it comes to coding, so as Noverita is developed and perfected, any and all code and resources put into the project will be comepletely publicly available.
## How to download
Noverita cannot currently be downloaded, but once a .exe/.jar file is ready, You will be able to download through two different ways:
1. Through Github
2. Through Novera.com
